# Leaf-Lens
Plant Disease Detection Project
Leaf Lens: Plant Leaf Disease and Species Identification
This project, "Leaf Lens," is designed to identify plant species and detect diseases from leaf images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It provides a user-friendly system for accurate and automated botanical identification.​

Description:
"Leaf Lens" is a mobile and web-based system that allows users to upload or capture an image of a plant leaf. The system then processes the image to detect the plant species and identify any potential diseases. It provides detailed information about the plant, including its name, species, and medicinal or agricultural importance. The goal of this project is to make plant identification more accessible and efficient for researchers, farmers, and enthusiasts.​

Features:
Plant Species Identification: Accurately classifies plant species from leaf images.​
Disease Detection: Identifies common plant diseases such as bacterial spot, late blight, and Septoria leaf spot.​
Informative Results: Provides users with detailed information about the identified plant.​
User-Friendly Interface: An easy-to-use interface for uploading and capturing leaf images.​

Technologies Used:
The project is built using a combination of Python and various machine learning and deep learning libraries.​

Python: The core programming language used for the project.​
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.​
Scikit-learn: Implemented for various classification and regression algorithms.​
NumPy: Utilized for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.​
Seaborn: A data visualization library for creating informative graphics.​
Deep Learning: The system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including architectures like ResNet, for image classification and feature extraction.
